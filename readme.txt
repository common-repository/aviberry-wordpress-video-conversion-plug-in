== How to use plugin? ==

= Variant 1. Converting from Media Library =
1.	Configure the WordPress plugin options, setting access parameters for Media Library. You can choose any other storage for the converted files but in that case they will not appear in Media Library.
2.	Switch to Media Library and chose convert options for your files.
3.	Wait until the conversion ends.
4.	The converted files will be delivered to the \wp-content\uploads folder and, if the option chosen, appear in Media Library right after you refresh the web page.

= Variant 2. Automatic conversion when creating a new post =
1.	In the Automatic Conversion section of the plugin options, choose a preset for automatic conversion.
2.	Configuring the Plugin options, choose the Media Library storage type and set the access options.
3.	Create a new post or start editing an existing one.
4.	Embed video (upload from a hard drive, insert from the Web or Media Library).
5.	Open extra options of a video file by clicking the Show link.
6.	Click the Convert with Aviberry button in the Link URL section.
7.	Click the Insert into Post button. The following shortcode will be added to the post: [aviberry_conversion source_attachment_id='<attachment id>' conversion_id='']. Place it wherever you like in the post.
8.	Save and post.
9.	Wait until the conversion ends.
10.	After the conversion is done, converted videos will be automatically delivered to Media Library and appear in the post instead of the shortcode. If you have turned on the player from the Plugin options, the video starts playing automatically through Aviberry player. 

= Variant 3. Using the Aviberry player =
1.	Configure the player parameters from the Plugin options.
2.	Create new or start editing an existing post.
3.	Paste a softcode [aviberry_player title="My video" href="http://my_wordpress_domain/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/video.mp4" width="400" height="300" id="2"].
4.	Post. There will be video instead of the shortcode.
